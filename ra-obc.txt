REPRODUCING AUTONOMY
— WORK, MONEY, CRISIS & CONTEMPORARY ART
by Kerstin Stakemeier & Marina Vishmidt

Progress in autonomy cannot be, nor historically has it
ever been, measured in quantitative units. Rather, the
need for autonomy has been repositioned in relation to
society’s political, economic, and cultural developments
on an ongoing basis. What do we mean when we
speak of ‘autonomy’ and ‘reproduction’ in the field of
contemporary art? What kind of objects do these terms
encompass, what are their histories, and what internal
logical relations can we identify between each of these
concepts? And what can we say about how they operate
in a philosophical discourse about art and within political
theory and practice?

In this book, Marina Vishmidt and Kerstin Stakemeier
analyse ‘autonomy’ and then ‘reproduction’, in the
understanding that this method of categorical isolation
must be overcome if we are to reach towards the
relationship of the two terms. These three essays
establish a new framework to locate notions of artistic
autonomy and autonomies of art. The texts not only offer
an entrance into thinking about the role that autonomy
has occupied in modern European intellectual history;
they also put forward an original thesis.
